# Introduction #

This repository contains scripts demonstrating some of the more 'advanced' features of the Python language.

If you can figure out the output of the following piece of code, you're good to start with the scripts in this repo: 

~~~~
import os, random
for i in xrange(random.randInt(12)):
	print i
~~~~
