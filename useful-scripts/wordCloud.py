	A word cloud is visual representation of the frequency of words in a corpus 
	with frequency of the word directly proportional to its font size in the representation

	Now the first step in creating the word cloud is to clean the corpus removing
	unnecessary punctuation. The next step is the hard part.

	Decision time.
